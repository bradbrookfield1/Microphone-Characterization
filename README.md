# Microphone-Characterization (Incomplete)
Obtain frequency response and power spectral density plots from microphone voltage data using MATLAB.

This program gives engineers and scientists the capability of characterizing microphones and other input audio devices with techniques including frequency response, sensitivity, and power spectral density analysis. Tools that are necessary for this program to function properly without any changes include:
1. Hewlett Packard 8903A Audio Analyzer
- Operating and Service Manual: https://www.waynekirkwood.com/images/pdf/HP_8903A_Audio_Analyzer-Service.pdf
2. National Instruments GPIB-USB-B Adapter
- FIX ME!!! and proper drivers and Keysight software connection interface
3. ExTech HD600: Datalogging Sound Level Meter
- English User's Manual: http://www.extech.com/products/resources/HD600_UM-en.pdf
- Data-logging app installation is on the flash drive that is included with the level meter. Installation details are given with its documentation.
4. MATLAB 2021b Release
- Instrument Control is a supplemental MATLAB app that is also required.
